Now, you are looking for "I am"...what? Nothing! what's wrong with just I am?

When we are born, we are stamped with some identities. Then we start accumulating
memories and more identities. Kid...memories of being kid, student...memories of being
student, son/daughter, brother/sister, friend/enemy, profession, father/mother and
many. What we do is that we presume some identity and we work to make it strong. 
To make it strong, we need evidence and we need more of it. Essentially, the difference
between your dream and reality is just the evidence. Only you can testify your dream but
your reality is testified with more and more people. The people who testify it positively
are the people you consider your family, your friends.  Further, success(mostly) is
measured relatively by comparing with others, what you have or can do in your given identity
and others can't. Here, others could be just past of yourself. This is not success, this is just arrogance strengthen, no?

We are born with an Ego which just says that "I am". This is our individualism sense. This is what has been termed as ignorance in all our scriptures. The mind projected outwards works only this way that you will go on defining I am this and I am that, and none will satisfy you ever as given the nature of the world, your very identities will collapse one by one leaving you with just memories and one day not even that. So, hoping to attain perfect happiness in any of our outward tendencies is a myth! It is always going to be a mixed bag of pleasure and pain by its design. What a negative message, hmm? But, True!

So, what is our real identity then out of so many roles? I am... Him (शिवोहम्)! Realization of this identity is the ultimate goal, but realizing that nature is not trivial and it requires continuous seeking and turning our mind inwards. Till the time we acquire an eternal identity, I think, it is sufficient to realize that "just I am" watching all of your identities and perform your duties. A good sense of duty is that you are serving others or at least you think so!
